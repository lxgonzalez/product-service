3. Configure Environment Variables

In the root directory, create a .env file and add your MongoDB connection details:
  ```bash
 > MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
 > MONGODB_DB_NAME=your_database_name
  ```
4. Run the application
   
 ```bash
   npm start
  ```
5. Connecting to the Service

Once the application is running, you can access the service by opening your browser and navigating to: http://localhost:4000

6. Sending GraphQL Request

To delete a product, send a mutation request via GraphQL to the following endpoint: http://localhost:4000/graphql

**GraphQL Request Example:**
 ```bash
   mutation {
  deleteProduct(id: "your_product_id") {
    success
    message
  }
}
  ```
**Example using curl:**
 ```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/graphql' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "query": "mutation { deleteProduct(id: \"your_product_id\") { success message } }"
}'
  ```
Note: In the id field, replace "your_product_id" with the ID of the product you wish to delete.
